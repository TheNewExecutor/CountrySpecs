I thought it would be interesting to check out the statistics of nations especially when the political mantra of the time is to \"Make America Great Again\". Just how does the United States, or any other country for that matter compare with the rest of the world? The database I found on Kaggle had some interesting numbers, but lacked annotation of units, may have had incorrect information, and had string entries for data. This motivated me to try and make my own.\n",

To systematically convert field names on the website to SQL-friendly titles we apply the following rules:\n",

    "- Special character phrases to be removed:  \" (-)\", \"(+)\", \"(\", \")\"\n",
    "- Special character phrases to be replaced with an underscore: \" - \", \"/\", \" \"\n",

    "### Unique Column Names\n",

    "Each country will fall among the following scenarios to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data is only a single number like in \"Population\" and has no subfield, so the column will be assigned the value of field.\n",

    "Once unique column names are generated, we must also make sure they are compatible with SQL constraints.\n",

    "1. Column names must not start with number characters, which is sometimes a problem encountered in subfields referring to ages or lengths. This can be checked with regular expressions.\n",
